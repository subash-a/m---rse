The application was mainly built since it was fun to convert morse code to text and vice versa. The applications for this include sending messages in a text file using dots and dashes either through mail or other medium. Enhancements that can be added are

* Output morse code via audio.

* Input morse code via microphone to read and convert into text.

Anyone interested can send me a pull request with the changes, I would be happy to include the addition into the project.
